Meanbee Customer Feedback Extension
=====================
How do you currently gauge the health of the relationships with your customers? More often than not, our interpretation of customer satisfaction level is based on the (hopefully!) rare disgruntled email.

Build a natural feedback loop into your customer's journey by asking them a simple question at the end of their checkout.

The first step to fixing a problem is measuring it. Asking for a simple rating, out of ten, at end of the checkout will provide insight. An optional comment box is provided for the customer that's feeling particularly helpful.
